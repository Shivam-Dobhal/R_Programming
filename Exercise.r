# Simple R code to visualize numbers from 1 to 10
# numbers <- 1:10

# Plotting a scatter plot
# plot(numbers, pch = 10, col = "blue", main = "Numbers from 1 to 10", xlab = "Index", ylab = "Value")








# Generating a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10
# numbers <- 1:20

# Plotting a scatter plot
# plot(numbers, pch = 20, col = "#ee1d05", main = "Numbers from 1 to 108", xlab = "index", ylab = "Value")
